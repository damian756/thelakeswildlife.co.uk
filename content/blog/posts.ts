It needs warm, shallow, temporary pools in open, sandy habitat — a combination that puts it squarely in conflict with the general direction of land use in England over the past century.

          "Dune slacks are the shallow, wet hollows between dune ridges that flood in winter and dry out in summer. The water temperature in these pools rises rapidly in spring sunshine, which is exactly what Natterjack spawn needs. Common Toad and Common Frog prefer cooler, deeper water — the dune slack is a niche that Natterjacks have evolved to exploit with very little competition.",
          "The problem is that dune slacks are rare and getting rarer. Coastal development, stabilisation of dune systems and reduced grazing all reduce the extent and quality of slack habitat. On the Sefton Coast, active management — scrub removal, cattle grazing, and in some cases the creation of new shallow pools — is specifically aimed at maintaining the conditions Natterjacks need.",

They're common in the Irish Sea. They're not dangerous. At full size they're about 60–80cm long and live on the seabed.",
          "The leathery case — made from collagen fibres, structurally similar to fingernail — is produced by the female to protect a single fertilised egg. She deposits it on rocky or kelpy seabed, where the four curly tendrils at the corners anchor it in place. The embryo develops inside for nine to twelve months, nourished by a yolk sac. Once the pup hatches, the empty case detaches and drifts until it washes ashore.",
