      "The Natterjack Toad is Britain's rarest amphibian. It needs warm, shallow, temporary pools in open, sandy habitat — a combination that puts it squarely in conflict with the general direction of land use in England over the past century. The Sefton Coast is one of its last strongholds. Here's why that matters, and what's being done to keep it that way.",

          "Dune slacks are the shallow, wet hollows between dune ridges that flood in winter and dry out in summer. The water temperature in these pools rises rapidly in spring sunshine, which is exactly what Natterjack spawn needs. Common Toad and Common Frog prefer cooler, deeper water — the dune slack is a niche that Natterjacks have evolved to exploit with very little competition.",
          "The problem is that dune slacks are rare and getting rarer. Coastal development, stabilisation of dune systems and reduced grazing all reduce the extent and quality of slack habitat. On the Sefton Coast, active management — scrub removal, cattle grazing, and in some cases the creation of new shallow pools — is specifically aimed at maintaining the conditions Natterjacks need.",

Population estimates fluctuate considerably year to year depending on weather — a cold, wet spring can reduce breeding success dramatically.",

The Sefton Coast has acted as a donor site for reintroductions elsewhere in England. This is careful, permit-controlled work — you cannot collect spawn without a Natural England licence.",
          "On-site translocation — moving egg-strings between pools within the Ainsdale system — has also been used to supplement struggling sub-populations. It requires monitoring the receiving pools post-translocation to assess success.",

In good conditions, the calling from a Natterjack colony at Ainsdale on a warm May night is audible from 300 metres or more.",

          "The lesson, as usual with conservation on the Sefton Coast, is that nothing maintains itself. The moment the management stops, scrub moves in, pools deepen and shade over, and the conditions that make Natterjack survival possible disappear within a few years.",

          "The key plant in dune formation is Marram Grass. It tolerates burial by sand and actually grows faster when covered — its roots bind the sand and its stems trap more. Without Marram, dune systems don't accumulate. With it, they can build to ten or fifteen metres in height.",
