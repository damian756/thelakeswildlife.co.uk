          Marshside is worth visiting any time of year. The honest answer is that October through March is the best of it — but there&apos;s always something happening.

            <p className="text-[var(--slate)] text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Pink-footed Geese arrive from Iceland in October and by November there can be 80,000+ on the Ribble Estuary. Stand on the sea wall around dusk and you&apos;ll hear the noise before you see anything — a low, constant calling that builds until the sky goes dark with birds. It&apos;s one of the best wildlife spectacles in the North West and it costs nothing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[var(--slate)] text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
              Through winter the lagoons hold Teal, Wigeon, Shoveler and Pintail. Ruff and Golden Plover work the fields behind the reserve. If it&apos;s cold and clear, check for Short-eared Owl quartering the saltmarsh at dusk.

            <p className="text-[var(--slate)] text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Avocets breed on the scrapes — usually 10–20 pairs. Lapwing and Redshank nest on the marsh. Sedge Warblers and Reed Buntings arrive in April. Summer wader passage starts in May with Dunlin, Ringed Plover and the occasional Ruff still in breeding plumage.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[var(--slate)] text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
              Keep dogs strictly on leads from April onwards. Those Avocets have flown from West Africa to nest here.

            <p className="text-[var(--slate)] text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Wader passage picks up in late July. Greenshank, Green Sandpiper, Little Stint and Curlew Sandpiper all pass through. Numbers build through August — by mid-August the main scrape can hold 200–400 Dunlin. September brings Black-tailed Godwit in large flocks on the inner marsh.

              The geese start coming back from Iceland from late September. The first skeins of the season are always a good moment.

          The path along the outside of the sea wall — on the Redshank Road coastal side — is a completely different experience from the reserve walk. Exposed, flat, with tidal pools and the Ribble Estuary to your right. This is the Marshside Saltmarsh: part of the Ribble Estuary Special Protection Area.

        <p className="text-[var(--slate)] mb-5 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          Stay on the track. The saltmarsh holds ground-nesting birds, and soft mud and incoming creeks make going off-path genuinely dangerous. In an emergency, grid reference SD 353204 — dial 999 and ask for the Coastguard.

        <p className="text-[var(--slate)] mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          <strong>By car:</strong> From Southport, head north along Marshside Road (postcode PR9 9PH). For Nel&apos;s Hide and the RSPB car park, follow signs for Redshank Road off Marine Drive — the blue &apos;RSPB Marshside P&apos; directional signs are visible at the junction. Grid reference SD 353204. The car park is locked at closing time — do not stay past 4pm (winter) or 5pm (summer).
        </p>
        <p className="text-[var(--slate)] mb-10 text-sm leading-relaxed">
          <strong>By public transport:</strong> Southport is on the Merseyrail Northern Line from Liverpool. The reserve is about 25 minutes on foot from Lord Street, or a short bus ride to Marshside Road.
