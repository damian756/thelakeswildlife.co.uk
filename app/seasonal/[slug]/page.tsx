Every autumn, tens of thousands fly south from their Icelandic breeding grounds and settle on the Ribble Estuary and surrounding farmland. By November, there can be 80,000 or more in the area. It is one of the great wildlife spectacles in England — and most people have never heard of it.",

          "Evening flighting is equally good — watch from the same spot an hour before dusk as the birds come back onto the estuary. In the right light it's unforgettable.",
